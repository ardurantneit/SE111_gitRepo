    <script>
        //everything inside of the script tags MUST be written in JAVASCRIPT!
        
        //creating a variable -- keyword "var"
        var num1 = 10

        var num2 = 7

        //cannot use num1 or num2 in a process unless they have been DEFINED (value stored to them)
        var sum = num1 + num2

        //output -- 2 ways

        //alert() pop-up window to browser to page; user must interact (click button) before further code is read

        //` ` denotes a literal string which makes it much easier to display messages + stored value (Simila to useing .format() --> `${VAR}` displays sotred value of var)

        alert(`the sunm of ${num1.toFixed(2)} + ${num2toFixed(2)} = ${sumtoFixed(2)}`)

        //console.log() -- GREAT FOR TESTING! displays to console only, not for regular user

        console.log(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)
        console.log(`hit line 41`)//msg only
        console.log(sum)          //Value only


        //input -- gain data from the user with javascript ONLY

        //prompt() -- prompts user for value with msg, further lines of code are not read until user hits OK/Cancel/Enter key
        //prompt(`Enter your name: `)

        //store the returned value from prompts ()
        var fname = prompt(`Enter your first name: `)

        //concatenatation -- adds strings together

        var full = fname + " "+ lname

        alert(` Hi there ${fname}!\n\nYour full name is: ${full}`)

        //escape sequences work within strings """. '', or ``

        //returns from prompt()are strings meaning you must cast a value as number() if you want to do math with it!

        var num = prompt(`Enter a number: `)
        num = Number(num) //cast as number
        console.log(num)
