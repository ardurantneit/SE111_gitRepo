            <p><em><b>The Big Man </b></em><i>2/8/2022</i></p>
            <p><i>"I believe this movie to be the best film to ever be released. It's great selection of cast and their performance really make the movie great to watch. The amount of humor and sublte adult jokes make this movie great for both the kids and parents. THe amount of refrences in this movie make it feel rewarding to those who can pick up on their sublty."</i></p>
            
            <p><i>"Having the Rock as one of the main characters really shows his range as an actor. The amount of drive he has really made him do great in his first animated movie. His power in the role really made the main character stand out compared to others.</i></p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>When Chuck and Lem first meet at the planetarium, Chuck tells Lem about his plans when arriving on their planet. In the Brazilian release, Chuck says he was planning on thrusting the American flag on the planet's soil, playing some golf and coming back to Earth on time for the Rio 2016 Olympics, because golf would be one of the selected sports. The movie was released in Brazil shortly after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the 2016 Olympics would be held in Rio de Janeiro. </li>
                
                <li>All the female aliens wear dresses. The males wear shirts without pants. </li>
                
                <li>Production lasted sixteen months, roughly half the amount of time it takes to make a Pixar movie. </li>
            </ul>
