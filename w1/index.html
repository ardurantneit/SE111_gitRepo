        <p>Hi KT, nothing really changed since the last "about me" project you had me do. I still am interested in building an offroad vehicle and developed more of a plan for that, by the time I pay off my car the next gen 4runners should be circualting the used market so I'm gonna see if I can find on a deal on one. I am hyped for this class since html and java are the only two languages I know how to do. It's been a while since I actually used them but once I the rust comes off I should be good. You said that you wanted a <b>bold</b>, <i>italicized</i>, and <u>underlined</u> word in here so there you go. I know that I probably wont use these two languages often in my career path but I am still excited to learn from this class. :)</p>
